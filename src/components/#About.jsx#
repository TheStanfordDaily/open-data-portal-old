    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Stanford Open Data Project (SODP) is making data about Stanford University more accessible\
 and transparent. Our Open Data Portal allows anyone to find and analyze Stanford-related data, such \
as university finances, student life, and academics.</p>

    <p>SODP works in collaboration with <a href="http://www.stanforddaily.com">The Stanford Daily</a>\
, Stanford's premier publication. Student journalists are constantly trying to write impactful storie\
s about the university, but they often struggle to find relevant data that would strengthen their nar\
ratives. Even if this data can be located, often it is unprocessed and difficult to use. Additionally\
, there are many stories that wouldn't be discovered without seeing the data first. As a result, SODP\
's convenient access to Stanford data is immensely valuable for The Stanford Daily. </p>

    <p>SODP is also the recipient of <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/build">Coding It Forwar\
